<iframe src="http://testbed.dcc.tudelft.nl/embed?stream=566ddfe1af" frameBorder="0" width=100% height=400></iframe>

## This is a very simple demonstration that shows the following:
- An embedded view of a model running in a speckle server instance running at [testbed.dcc.tudelft.nl](http://testbed.dcc.tudelft.nl)
- How you can use interactive books and documents like this to show rich documentations using the power of web technologies.
- An example of how documentation and collaboration can take place.
