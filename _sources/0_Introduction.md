# Introduction
In the Robotic Building Lab we try to incorporate FAIR best practices and workflows that allow us to mkae the data we produce more useful and reusable for ourselves and the scientifico community. We care about aspects of data and software management in the context of the Robotic Building domain. Aspects of this workflow go from documentation, to the creation of templates as well as the practice of version control among others. 

This website os meant to provide guidelines, how-tos and recommendations to implement more FAIR and reproducible research outputs.

## Refining our workflow
Workflows and best practices are heavily influenced by emerging technologies that empower us and allow us to be more productive. For instance the emergence of git and github tools to do code versionc control, as well as specific tools like speckle that can make our 3D models more interoperable, but also the filesystem in our computers.

We believe that the progressive adoption of standardized practices that work for us, like propper documentation, folder structuring, version control, use of metadata and so on,  improves our performance and practices in the lab.  

## FAIR principles for better science
FAIR stands for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperatbility and reusability of data. We try to articulate these principles in our domain so that our results are easier to reuse. 

#### Findable
The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource[2]

#### Accessible
Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available[2]

#### Interoperable
The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data[2]

#### Reusable
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

The principles refer to three types of entities: data (or any digital object), metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure. For instance, principle F4 defines that both metadata and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource (the infrastructure component).[2]
