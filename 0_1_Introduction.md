# Introduction
## How to use this website
This website is meant to provide context, share guides, recommendations and best practices related to Design to Robotic Production and Operation for our lab.

## What we do
In the Robotic Building (RB) Lab, research and education activities (incl. graduation projects) are implemented with the aim of developing Design-to-Robotic-Production and -Operation (D2RP&O) methods that advance robotization in architecture. Robotization is explored as resulting from human-computer and human-robot interactions where the manufacturing plant, the building site and the buildings themselves operate as cyber-physical systems within the larger Internet of Things and People.

## How we work in the Lab
Design to Robotic Production and Operation (D2RP&O) research and education activities are structured in additive, subtractive, and transformative workshops held in the lab. D2RP&O workshops are aimed at integrating different modes and methods of robotic production and operation into computational design processes in order to explore multi-performative systems in architecture. The workshops focus on developing D2RP&O methods for hybrid material systems, from micro to macro level as spatial, structural and architectural configurations.

## How to contribute to our knowledge base
In the Robotic Building Lab we try to incorporate FAIR best practices and workflows that allow us to make the data we produce more useful and reusable for ourselves and the scientifico community. We care about aspects of data and software management in the context of the Robotic Building domain. Aspects of this workflow go from documentation, to the creation of templates as well as the practice of version control among others. It is therefore important for us that our results are reproducible and easy to reuse in the first place. Best practices on data management and good documentation is essential to us.
